# TAMSCon #1 - London and Virtual

### Tuesday 10th and Wednesday 11th March

The first ever TAMSCon will bring together the whole TAMS community for the first time.  We want to share with the community some of the progress over the last 12 months, as well as look forward to what is coming up in 2026.  This session is for those that have been in the community since the start or may just be starting to look at TAMS.  Session will be held principally in London at the AWS office in Holborn, but there will be option for virtual participation.

### Day 1
The morning will be a set of presentations including:

* Updates from some key customers on where they are in their TAMS adoption journeys
* Quick fire sessions from a selection of new partners who have deployed TAMS support in their products
* An update on the TAMS Governance and a chance to ask questions about what it means

The afternoon will break out into a set of different tracks:

1. For those new to TAMS there will be a 101 stream focusing on what TAMS is and how it works
2. A focus on what TAMS means for business leaders and operational teams
3. Advanced technical sessions focusing on some of the proposed changes to the TAMS specification

The day will end with drinks and a chance to network

### Day 2
The second day is a more informal session and is not mandatory to attend both days.  The day will include 3 key workstreams:

1. For partners with TAMS capable products, there will be a chance to test interoperability between them and focus on ensuring consistency across the TAMS experience.

2. We will be running a hands-on workshop for those new to TAMS who would like to dive deeper and understand it better.  This will include deploying a TAMS instance, creating content and then deploying the TAMS Tools to interact with the store.

3. A drop in TAMS Surgery will be avialable with experts on hand to answer questions, talk through workflows and help think about what TAMS could mean for your company.
