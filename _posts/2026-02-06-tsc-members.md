This post is intended to support the [communication](https://github.com/bbc/tams/blob/main/GOVERNANCE.md) set out on 28<sup>th</sup> January 2026, which details the process of moving TAMS towards open governance. This document details how the remaining two seats on the initial TAMS TSC will be filled.

The proposed TSC is composed as follows:  
<br/>**_TSC Members_**

_The TSC is intended to be a balanced mixture of members from the community of technology vendors, of broadcasters and customers of TAMS, alongside the BBC R&D team working to evolve TAMS across the board. It is expected this mix will change in time._

_At the time of writing, the TSC membership is still being identified, and we would like to hear from individuals interested in joining. This sets out a broad shape of the group:_

- _Sam Mesterton-Gibbons (BBC)_
- _James Sandford (BBC)_
- _Richard Lynton-Evans (BBC)_
- _John Biltcliffe (AWS)_
- _Chris Swan (AWS)_
- _&lt;Another broadcaster/content owner/user organisation&gt;_
- _&lt;A vendor organisation&gt;_

As such, there are 2 open 'seats' on the TSC. These two seats will be appointed by the initial TSC members by a simple majority vote.

All expressions of interest will be considered, however to maintain a balance of roles in the TSC, the selection will be subject to the person specification below:  
<br/>Seat 1: An engineer, solution architect or equivalent involved with a broadcaster or content owner, who understands and has been involved in TAMS for some time, is aligned with the vision and principles of the technology, and is considering rolling it out.

Seat 2: An engineer, solution architect or equivalent involved with a vendor who makes a TAMS-native technology which is being trialled by customers. They should have a deep understanding of the technology and be aligned with the vision for TAMS and our principles

The TSC is a technical body for guiding the open-source TAMS API specification. As such, the role is expected to be technical in nature. There will be opportunities for individuals and companies to support TAMS in non-technical ways (e.g. events or marketing), but this is not the primary purpose of a role on the TSC.

In addition, it is also expected that an 'individual' express their interest to be considered, rather than this being a representative of a 'company' on the TSC, however it is expected that they will have the support of their company to take on this role.

**Role and responsibilities**

Interested individuals will be expected to:

- Join/lead TSC calls
- Review and contribute to changes to the TAMS specification
- Be prepared to lead a working group to deep dive into certain aspects of the TAMS specification or workflow
- Be part of the team maintaining the TAMS specification repository and associated materials
- Represent the TAMS community at industry events
- Take a lead in organising and creating content for TAMS community events (monthly community call, annual TAMS conference)

It is also expected that interested individuals will have an existing, and ongoing, record of contributing to TAMS in the form of GitHub contributions, discussions around changes to the specification, representing the needs of the industry as it relates to TAMS, or in the form of thought leadership in the industry at large.

Interested individuals should put together a short summary of how they fulfil the person specification set out, and send it to any named member of the TSC by Friday 13<sup>th</sup> March 2026. The TSC will collate expressions of interest, and meet to come to a decision by the end of March 2026. We hope to use the TAMSCon Community Event on 10<sup>th</sup> and 11<sup>th</sup> March 2026 to meet with interested parties.
