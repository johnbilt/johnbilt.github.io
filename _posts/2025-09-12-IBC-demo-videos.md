## Fast-turnaround workflows using TAMS

Fast-turnaround workflows for news, sports, and live entertainment face challenges of vendor lock-in and inflexible or costly solutions. Customers can address these challenges by using the open-source Time-addressable Media Store (TAMS) API on AWS to ingest live feeds into a scalable timeline of media elements. The TAMS API provides a common means to access time-addressed media for multiple production workflow tools. This eliminates redundant data duplication and enables efficient workflows across platforms and teams. This demo shows an end-to-end cloud-native workflow using TAMS on AWS, including ingest, content manipulation in browser-based and virtual workstation-based editors, export for social media, AI analysis of segments, and playout to a live production gallery.

## Near-live news distribution using TAMS

Distributing near-live news and sports content to partners remains inefficient, relying on costly, point-to-point delivery methods that create delays. We demonstrate how a news agency - Reuters - solves this by leveraging the open-source Time-Addressable Media Store (TAMS) API on AWS. In this live demonstration, Reuters publishes feeds of content from the UK Parliamentary Broadcasting Unit into TAMS, allowing its customers to immediately access, clip, and pull the segments they need on demand. This powerful, interoperable supply chain creates efficiency, while providing more flexible contribution and distribution of content.
